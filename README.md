# Curanostics-Dashboard

This dashboard serves as a way for users to have their health information displayed in a visually pleasing and interactive format. The dashboard consists of the following features:

Gamification: 
- Trivia questions sourced from OpenFDA API
- Step tracker with data sourced from Mockaroo
- Timeline of the user's previous and upcoming visits

Logs:
- Hydration log
- Exercise log

Passport:
- Displays "cards" containing a user's past cases, their status, and details about the case

The website also contains other functions:

Welcome Page:
- The user is able to log in or create an account with verified and secure user information.

Settings:
- The user is able to change their personal information (username, password, profile picture, etc.).

All of the backend APIs were tested with Postman and Django REST in order to verify their working ability.
